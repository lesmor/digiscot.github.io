### Project description

The project will target ethnic minority women who have been working with Saheliya & progressed enough to be in a position to cope with the language & learning demands of basic computing classes. We will work in partnership utilising the expertise of the Digital Skills Academy (DSA) to deliver a high quality learning programme which will offer Microsoft Digital Literacy certification.

The project will give the learners essential skills to help with the process of integration & employment which they have embarked on with Saheliya. The project will have a significant impact on the women we will support, giving them the skills to enable them to search for & obtain work, access public & consumer services, pay bills, search for cost savings for utilities & goods, have social contact with others & even keep up with their children’s activities online.

Giving people the skills they are expected to have automatically by the welfare system, enables them to meet Jobcentre expectations & help avoid the possibility of sanctions which are having a major impact on people living in poverty.

The project will be delivered in Saheliya premises where learners can access existing equipment in the form of PCs, laptops & tablets. They will also access in-house childcare which will facilitate their learning. This combination of expert digital learning support & the emotional & practical support offered by Saheliya makes this project unique.

The classes will be delivered in 2 half-day sessions per week by an experienced IT trainer & will run for up to 8 weeks. We plan for 6-7 people in each class (12 per week) who will be supported by at least 1 volunteer. We will run 3 of these classes over the course of one year.

We plan to recruit volunteers from Saheliya clients who have more advanced IT skills. Our evidence from working with clients is that there is a sufficient number of more highly educated & experienced clients to provide this aspect of the service. The evidence of DSA is that the role of volunteers is crucial to ensure individualised learning can be achieved.
Individual assessments will take place at the start of each course to enable an individualised learning plan to be developed for each learner. The use of volunteers enables the learners to develop at their own pace. In addition, we plan to engage at least 2 members of Saheliya staff to train to become digital champions. This will embed the project in the organisation & enable the staff to run additional drop-in sessions to provide practice opportunities for the learners to continue to access the equipment on an additional half day per week during the class.

### Planned project milestones

* The first class will be recruited and delivery started: December 2015
* Milestone 1 Update
* As this is a partnership project, we started the project by developing a project plan to make sure that both partners understood their role and their contribution to reaching the project milestones.
* We recruited for our first group of learners in December by holding assessments to make sure the class was the right thing for them. They started their training in January. The women have varying levels of English which has meant that we have had to develop our existing learning materials so that they were suitable for ESOL learners.  We have also developed additional learning material to meet their needs.
* The project has been a steep learning curve for everyone concerned but extremely rewarding. There will be lots to report in 'Lessons leared' by the time the project has finished. The learners are very motivated, coming in early to get extra practice and not stopping for a break.  We recruited 6 learners initially with a further 4 in the process of recruitment at the moment. 3 learners have now passed their Microsoft Basic Digital Literacy certificates and are now ready to continue at a different class to improve their Microsoft Word skills.  The other learners need slightly more time due to the language barrier but we expect them to be up to speed soon.

Our first recruits

* Recruit and train 2 volunteers to support the delivery of further training: January 2016
* We recruited 1 volunteer from Saheliya clients and a second volunteer who had already been helping with Digital Skills Academy's Use IT courses, but had experience of teaching ESOL.  Her experience is extremely useful and has allowed us to give 1-1 support to those who were finding learning more of a challenge.

One of our final students, Naija, has come a long way since starting the course.

* Train 2 staff members of Saheliya to become digital champions: October 2016
In November our trainer delivered digital chamption training to 2 members of staff.  It had hoped that more staff would become involved but it proved very difficult for them to dedicate the time necessary from their busy schedules.  However, the general awareness of staff of the importance of digital literacy was raised by referring clients and getting positive feedback of the benefits of the training.

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Development of basic digital literacy training will become embedded in Saheliya through the training of the digital champions
* Volunteers will be given the opportunity to gain workplace skills and experience to add to their CVs
* 36 ethnic minority women will have the skills to search for & obtain work, access public & consumer services, pay bills, search, have social contact thereby reducing discrimination & social isolation
*By training 2 Saheliya staff members we will leave a legacy for sustainability


### Evaluation



### Lessons learned
The courses started in January 2016 with 6 women starting the course. We quickly found that understanding English was more of an issue than originally thought, despite the partner organisation, Saheliya having worked with the target group for many years. This was due to the technical language used around computers. To tackle this an ESOL teacher revised the learning materials to simplify the language used and also produced a 'jargon buster' to explain some of the technical terms they would encounter.  This was very effective and we found that the training supported the improvement of their English language skills.

Another factor was the lack of confidence experienced by the students.  This was also much more of an issue than originally planned. It meant that the 8 weeks originally planned was much longer for some women.  It was agreed by the partners at a Milestone Meeting that it was more important for the students to be given enough time to feel confident in their new skills rather than having an aribitrary cut off date.  This meant we were not able to take as many woman on the course as originally planned (24) but we felt that those who did had very solid skills and the confidence to use computers by themselves when they left.
The support of a volunteer was vital.  In particular, we recruited one of the students to train as a volunteer and she continued throughout the course. As she had a good understanding of how the students felt she contributed greatly to developing their confidence. We also used a volunteer from another project who had ESOL teaching experience and a lot of experience teaching digital literacy skills to support the project.
Childcare has been very important.  Delivered on the premises as Saheliya run a childcare social enterprise, it meant that the women could manage the organisation of dropping their children in the childcare facility which was then easily accessed from the training suite. This gave them peace of mind and removed a barrier from them attending the course.
Throughout the project we have recognised that the opportunity to practice has been vital to support learning. Space is very limited at Saheliya but they have done their best to offer additional drop-in sessions and one of the volunteers has supported this.

Case Studies
Fargana Nashrin
Fargana had some experience of using social media but lacked a grounding in digital skills. During the class she has learned the correct way to do things such as files and folders, how to save photos and email. She also learned some Word and Excel which would help her find work. She worked hard to practice in her own time which made a different. She enjoyed the social side of the class and praised how the trainer made her feel more confident. She also found it useful to learn how to use the laptop as well as ipad and mobile phone. The class has inspired Fargana to learn more and has joined other courses at Saheliya. However, her limited English meant that she was unable to take the Microsoft Basic Digital Literacy test and got an achievement certificate instead.

Mussarat Mahmood
Mussarat had not used a computer. Her children had tried to help her use her mobile but she was very nervous and felt she wouldn’t be able to learn anything. She was so nervous the first couple of sessions, she didn’t enjoy the class. However, she kept attending and slowly gained a bit of confidence. She also needed to use Google Translate due to her poor English.  She worked hard in her own time and bought a book on computing to help her practice. Mussarat was stressed with poor health and difficult family demands.  She learned during the class it was important to set time aside for herself to practice. She felt that by learning she was able to help her children, talk to her mum on Skype and WhatsApp, do online shopping, top up her phone online and even keep up with her children on Facebook.  In the end she passed the Microsoft Basic Digital Literacy test.
The best thing for Mussarat has been the fact that her children are no longer embarrassed by her lack of digital skills compared to other parents and uses her mobile phone camera at school events.
Tangila  Akter
Tangila had a computer at home which she used to Skype family abroad and to find children’s games.  However, she had no experience of Microsoft Office which she was particularly interested in as she is looking for work and thinks this will help her. She was very positive about learning and wants to help her children with school work. She is planning to sit the Microsoft Basic Digital Literacy test and continue practising at the drop-in sessions.
